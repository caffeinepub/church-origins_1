  "summary": "The diff does not show the required static hero image asset being added/updated at the mandated public path, nor any verifiable changes in `AuthGate.tsx` to preserve existing fallback behavior. Only a metadata/state file and a frontend summaries file were modified, which is insufficient evidence that REQ-1/2/3 were implemented.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no added/modified static asset under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (no `home-hero.dim_1600x600.jpg` file change is present). Without the asset being added/updated, there is no evidence the URL will return HTTP 200 in deployment.",

      "requirement": "Update the hero image file content to use `image-8.png` while keeping the public URL path unchanged (`/assets/generated/home-hero.dim_1600x600.jpg`).",
      "reason": "No evidence in the diff that `frontend/public/assets/generated/home-hero.dim_1600x600.jpg` was created/updated, nor that it is a 1600×600 JPG derived from `image-8.png`.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Keep the existing landing-page hero image load-error fallback behavior in `frontend/src/components/AuthGate.tsx` so layout remains stable if the hero image fails to load.",
      "reason": "The diff does not include the actual contents/patch for `frontend/src/components/AuthGate.tsx`, only a high-level mention inside `frontend-file-summaries.txt`. This is not sufficient evidence that fallback behavior was preserved (or unchanged).",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest is narrowly scoped to ensuring a specific hero image asset exists/updates without changing layout/CTA behavior or other frontend areas; the diff summary text describes a wide set of unrelated UI/routing changes.",
