  "summary": "REQ-1 (reduce vertical gap between AuthGate hero image and headline) is partially addressed by adding negative margins, but the diff adjusts spacing on a wrapper <div> around the <img>, which violates the constraint to change spacing styles ONLY on the selected <img> and <h1> elements.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Adjust spacing styles ONLY on the selected hero <img> and selected main <h1> (per provided XPaths), without changing spacing for any other hero elements.",
      "reason": "The diff adds spacing-related styling (-mb-4) to the <div> wrapper around the <img>, not to the selected <img> element itself. This is outside the two selected elements and thus does not meet the 'ONLY these two selected elements' constraint/AC.",
