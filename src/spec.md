# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reduce/remove the extra vertical space between the AuthGate hero image and the main headline without affecting other hero content spacing.

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust spacing-related styles on the AuthGate hero `<img>` element to reduce the bottom gap above the headline.
- Adjust spacing-related styles on the AuthGate main `<h1>` element to reduce the top gap below the image.
- Verify the updated spacing does not cause overlap/cropping on common mobile and desktop breakpoints.

**User-visible outcome:** The AuthGate landing hero image and main headline appear closer together with noticeably less vertical whitespace, while the subheadline and CTA button spacing remains unchanged.
